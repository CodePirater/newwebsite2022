    "text": "Article–\nWashington nonprofits welcome arriving migrants bussed to Union Station every week.\nWhen Texas Gov. Abbott bussed migrants to Washington, D.C. on April 13, 2022, nonprofit organizations assisted the migrants arriving in Union Station every week. With an initial FEMA funding of $2 million in early September, Washington nonprofits share their experience tackling the crisis.\n“Seeing an influx of migrants coming in, we knew that as an immigrant organization, we had to help out in one way or another,” says Catherine Rubio, Director of Operations at Central American Resource Center (CARECEN) on assisting the bussed migrants. CARECEN primarily focuses on housing, counseling, and pro bono legal services for Central American immigrants but was first to welcome the migrants in April. She estimates that about 80-85% of migrants arriving in the district leave for another destination.\nSAMU First Response eventually lead in assisting the arriving migrants with CARECEN stepping into a supporting role. SAMU provides international humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants, which Tatiana Laborde, U.S. Managing Director of SAMU, says made sense for them to get involved. “After a month of working as volunteers, we sent a proposal for funding from FEMA,” says Ms. Laborde “and on June 22 we started operating under that grant”. She says the fund buys general supplies and bus or plane tickets for migrants leaving Washington. Although Texas and Arizona had been unwelcoming, Ms. Laborde says migrants have a better chance of being granted asylum from northern and democratic cities.\n“Texas is making it easier for the migrants to get their asylum approved because by percentages courts up north and in democratic cities are more open to approving their asylum cases,” which Ms. Laborde claims is only approving 17% of migrant cases compared to 75-80% in New York City. She estimates 9,000-10,000 migrants have arrived in Washington. Upon arriving, migrants are still reliant on the community. This where St. Peter’s Parish comes in. Rev. Daniel Carson says St. Peter’s offered their reception hall and parochial vicars to work alongside CARECEN and SAMU.\n“SAMU was looking for a place to do the processing, instead of having to do it right there at Union Station,” says Rev. Carson who explains they offer their parish “two or three days a week.” In one day, one or two buses arrive carrying 40 individuals in each. The parish has separate bathrooms for men and women, as well as clothes, food, and medical supplies.\nMigrants continue to arrive unsure of what awaits them with no indication of Texas and Arizona relenting, and Florida’s stunt in Martha’s Vineyard. Ms. Laborde recalls a mother who traveled from Venezuela who had her one-month-old baby brought to a children’s hospital.\n“She looked at me and said,”do you judge me for bringing my two children and my newborn in this journey?” and it was a matter of saying “No,” you did this because this is the only option you had, and I am nobody to judge you.”"
