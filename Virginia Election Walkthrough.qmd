Introduction: This Code Walkthrough will use the joined_vacomparison dataset to analyze the electoral performance of presidential and gubernatorial candidates during the national elections. This walkthrough will be a step by step guide into the process of using datasets as potential sources for stories. This includes a comparison of total votes between candidates, % difference of votes, as well as steps to visualize them into tables and charts.
